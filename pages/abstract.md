## Abstract 

Joseph Haydn served as court composer to Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy for nearly three decades (1762–1790). Nikolaus’s patronage of music was renowned in its own time, serving as a marker of aristocratic magnificence and an indicator of personal love for the art. He was, according to Haydn, more than just a patron and amateur musician, though. In the 1774 dedication of his six keyboard sonatas, Hob.XVI:21–26 (the “Esterházy” sonatas), Haydn described Nikolaus as possessing “complete mastery of music in its entirety.” Drawing on primary sources such as travel reports, theater chronicles, newspapers, letters, and employment contracts, this paper explores Nikolaus’s patronage of Haydn during the composer’s tenure at the Esterházy court. Nikolaus’s involvement extends beyond his construction of the Versailles-like Eszterháza palace and the facilitation of Haydn’s career. An examination of the “Esterházy” sonatas demonstrates how Nikolaus’s musical knowledge and aesthetic preferences for particular genres (opera and chamber music) and specific musical styles (learned) shaped Haydn’s music and played an active role in the composer’s meteoric rise to fame by the 1790s.
